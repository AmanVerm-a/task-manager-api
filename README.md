Task Manager API developed by me using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. 
The API provides a set of endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. 
Users can register and authenticate themselves to access their own tasks. 
The API supports features such as pagination, filtering, sorting, and file uploads. 
The code is well-organized and commented, making it easy to understand and extend. 
It is developed to practice and improve my theoratical knowledge on building a RESTful API using modern web development technologies.
